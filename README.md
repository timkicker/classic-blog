# Classic blog


![](./screenshot.png)

An alternative frontend to view my blog. I originally created this repo in order to make my website accessible for non-javascript browsers but php kinda grew on me (crazy, right?)

I also included a docker file in case you wanted to host it by yourself.

Important note: Since my real blog is implemented as a git sub-module, you'll have to update it manually via `git submodule update --recursive --remote`
